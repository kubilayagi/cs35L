Linux and Emacs Scavenger Hunt

1. You use the -k option to print the commands with a specific 
word in their man page
Example: man -k printf
This command will print all the commands that have the 
regular exression 'printf' in their man page

2. The command 'cp' is in the directory: /usr/bin/cp
The 'wc' command is in the directory: /usr/bin/wc

3. ls /usr/bin/?
three executables show up
/usr/bin/w
/usr/bin/X
/usr/bin/]

w - shows who is logged in and what they are doing

] - bash built in command

X - this returned that there was no entry for 'X' in the man pages,
I looked into why this was true and it is because in 2009, X was changed to Xorg
Because I was using the lnxsrv09 server, this update had already taken place

Xorg - a portable window system 

4. to find out which command is executed we use readlink:
command: readlink /usr/bin/emacs
/etc/alternatives/emacs
this is the file that is actually run

5. g+s sets groups ID on execution
o-x takes away execute permission from people other
than the owner and members of the file's group

6. -mtime -21

7. find / -mtime -21 -type d -ls

8. find /usr/bin/ -type l -ls | wc -l
293 of these files are symbolic links

9. man ls
cd /usr/lib
ls -lt

-rwxr-xr-x   1 root root   18692 Jan 26  2014 libgpg-error.so.0.10.0
libgpg-error.so.0.10.0 is the oldest file in the directory /usr/lib

10. man locale
man -k locale
man localedef

locale prints out environment vairables

the locale command gets its data from localedef

11. C-h a sort

Buffer-menu-sort              M-x ... RET
   Sort Tabulated List entries by the column at point.
sort-columns                  M-x ... RET
   Sort lines in region alphabetically by a certain range of columns.
sort-fields                   M-x ... RET
   Sort lines in region lexicographically by the ARGth field of each
   line.
sort-lines                    M-x ... RET
   Sort lines in region alphabetically; argument means descending
   order.
sort-numeric-fields           M-x ... RET
   Sort lines in region numerically by the ARGth field of each line.
sort-pages                    M-x ... RET
   Sort pages in region alphabetically; argument means descending
   order.
sort-paragraphs               M-x ... RET
   Sort paragraphs in region alphabetically; argument means descending
   order.
sort-regexp-fields            M-x ... RET
   Sort the text in the region region lexicographically.
tabulated-list-col-sort       M-x ... RET
   Sort Tabulated List entries by the column of the mouse click E.
tabulated-list-sort           M-x ... RET
   Sort Tabulated List entries by the column at point.

12. command to find stuff:
emacs
C-h r
(hit enter on key index)

C-M-a: Move to beginning of current or preceding defun
C-M-b: Move backward over a balanced expression
C-M-c: Exit the inner recursive edit
C-M-d: Move down in the parentheses structure
C-M-e: Move to end of current or following defun
C-M-f: Move forward over a balanced expression
C-M-g: Does not exist
C-M-h: Put region around whole current or following defun

13. C-g cancels a command before it finishes executing
This gets rid of a partially typed command or bad numeric argument
This command sets the quit flag to 't' which is recognize by an emacs check
Once this flag is 'non-nil' the program stops running

Looked in the emacs Key Index for the answer

14. C-h f yank

Reinserts the last stretch of killed text

15. The dired command in emacs shows hidden files that ls does not.
The dired command is also interactice, letting you perform actions on files
and navigate through the filesystem.
