Partner: Baolinh Nguyen

First I logged into my beaglebone using the command:
sudo ssh root@192.168.7.2

from there, I set up the account information for my
partner. I ran

ssh-keygen

and when I was prompted for the passphrase, I typed:

passphrase: cs35l

Then to set up the account, I used the follwing commands:

sudo useradd -d /home/baolinh -m baolinh
sudo passwd

and I entered the very secure password of: baolinh

After this, I created a directory called .ssh
mkdir .ssh

and I changed the ownership and permission so that my parter
had full access within the directory:

sudo chown -R baolinh .ssh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh

I then used cd /home/baolinh and used ifconfig to find the IP address

I tried pinging my account on baolinh's beagle bone:
ping -i2 kubilay@172.30.34.165

But from here, we were getting errors that were saying we were connecting
to an unknown host.

We decided to change to the Boelter 3760 network to see if it was an issue
with the UCLA_WIFI network

connmanctl
scan wifi
services
agent on
connect wifi_23840239840 etc...

Since we are on a new network, we need to update our IP addresses because
they change when you connect to a new network:

ifcongig

From this command, we found that the IP address for my machine is
10.97.85.253

And the IP address for Baolinh's machine is 
10.97.85.252

Now we try again to ping each other's machine:
ping -i2 kubilay@10.97.85.252

But again, we get the error:
ping: unknown host kubilay@10.97.85.252

However, after Baolinh fixed an issue with her wifi conection,
we ran the command:

ssh-copy-id -i kubilay@10.97.85.252

It worked!

We are prompted if we want to continue connecting, which we do,

Then we type in our passphrases for the accounts that we set up previously

We get the output:

Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'kubilay@10.97.85.252'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.

Following the suggested instructions from the output, I typed in
ssh kubilay@10.97.85

Then we get the prompt:
Enter passphrase for key '/root/.ssh/id_rsa':

For some reason, every time I log in or try to ssh, I am prompted to
enter the root password. I probably messed something up when I was trying
to set passwords. I will fix this later, it is not important to the lab.

Then I was prompted for my account password:
kubilay@10.97.85.252's password: 

Which we had set up earlier. Once I typed my password in, I was logged into
my account. To test to see if we could see each other's footprint on the
server, we both created a file to leave for the other person:

touch hey_baolinh.txt

Then I logged out to see if I could see the file that she created on
my machine:

exit
cd /home/baolinh
ls

And we can see that she left the file:
hi_kubilay.txt

On my machine, which means that it worked!!!

We also modified each others files to see if the changes showed up on each
other's machines. We both saw the change that we left for the other.
