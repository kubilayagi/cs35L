In the top left, we see the history of commits in a tree-like structure.
Each node represents a commit, and each one has a commit message. This is
a visualisation of the repository.

In the top middle window, we see a list of people who made commits to the 
repository and the email for each one.

In the top right, we see the dates of each commit. These dates line up with the
names of the authors of each commit so we can see when someone commited a 
particular change.

In the bottom right, there is a list of files that were changed by a particular
commit. 

In the bottom left, we see a screen that resembles a ChangeLog because it has
the author, the date, the email, and the description of changes that were made
to the files.
